## Lesson 5: SlotFill

With the introduction of Gutenberg in WordPress 5.0, developers lost the ability to extend the post editor using PHP hooks. Instead, we now have the SlotFill system. At a high level, the SlotFill system allows developers to inject UI elements into Gutenberg into a predefined set of locations. For the full list of available locations please refer to the [SlotFills Reference docs on developer.wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/slotfills/)

For a much deeper dive into the entire SlotFill system and how it works internally, [watch this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMD0WpMaXEo) from the 2019 JavaScript for WordPress conference.
